## Reclaim SOL From Rent

One of the primary utilities of ClaimSolana.io is to help users recover SOL that is locked up paying rent for empty SPL (Solana Program Library) token accounts.

### What Are SPL Token Accounts?

Every time you receive a Memecoin, Token, or NFT in your Solana wallet, a specific SPL token account is automatically created to store that particular asset.
*   When you sell or send the entire balance of that asset, the token account becomes empty but remains associated with your wallet.
*   These empty accounts often serve no further utility but continue to exist on the network.

### What Is Rent on Solana?

The Solana Network charges a "rent" fee for storing data on the blockchain. This includes data for all accounts, such as your main wallet account and every SPL token account.
*   Each of these token accounts costs approximately **~0.002 SOL** in rent. This SOL is essentially withheld by the Solana Network to cover the cost of storage and maintenance for a period (typically 2 years, after which it can become rent-exempt if sufficiently funded, or data may be purged if rent is not paid).
*   You can find more detailed information in the [official Solana Documentation on Rent](https://docs.solana.com/developing/programming-model/accounts#rent).

These residual, empty token accounts take up space and represent "lost" SOL that could be recovered.

### How ClaimSolana.io Helps

ClaimSolana.io scans your wallet for these empty SPL token accounts. It then allows you to easily close these accounts, and the SOL that was being held for their rent (the ~0.002 SOL per account) is returned directly to your main SOL balance.

    Click the "Select Wallet" (or similar) button and connect your preferred Solana wallet (e.g., Phantom, Solflare, Backpack).

3.  **Review and Prepare to Claim:**

    To proceed, press the **"CLAIM"** button.

4.  **Approve Transactions:**
    Your wallet will prompt you to approve one or more transactions. These transactions are necessary to instruct the Solana network to close the empty accounts. Review the transaction details carefully.
